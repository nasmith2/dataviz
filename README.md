# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is about [how people think about technology change in the next 50 years](https://gist.github.com/nasmith2/f7306cec68cf23c53a77f03efe7d70c0#file-technologychangebetterorworse-csv). As technology is developing at a fast rate, understanding how people feel about the upcoming change is important to know. This data is only 5 years old but it gets important data about some of the technology changes that are currently happening. For example, it asked people if they would want to ride in a autonomous car. This is something that is being developed now and is close to being on the roads and is even on some roads in certain countries. 

Another factor it asks about is how people feel about granting drones privileges to fly in the US airspace. Drones in themselves have a huge market if they continue to develop. Finding out how people feel about drones flying around can show if companies need to help promote the benefits of drones flying. The data also shows what people do not want to see in future technology changes. Interestingly enough, by looking at the data in the prototype one can find see that even though most people think that the change in technology will be for the better, most examples that were given the majority of people think they would be the change for the worse.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a quick look at how people feel about some technology changes. Surprisingly it shows that even though the majority of people think that technology change in the next 50 years will be for the better. Several of the asked topics would be bad changes in the majority of people's opinion.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

Overall, do people think technology change is good/bad and in what instances?
<br />Is there a correlation between the age or age range and if people think certain aspects are good/bad?
<br />Does education and/or income matter?
<br />Does it matter where someone lives in the country? 
**<br /> Task**: If a user clicks on a section of the center pie graph, it will change the other pie graphs to only use that data. For example, if a user clicks on the green section (for the better) all the surrounding pie charts will change to only use the data from the people who think it is for the better. It will also change the center circle by fading out the other sections to highlight the selected section. An example of this is already done but instead of the interactive feature, it is a menu option.

## Sketches

Sketch 1

The first sketch shows the initial startup screen. If someone selects the show on map option it will show the following:

Sketch 2 is supposed to show a pie chart per region

So, my plan is to take the prototype and add a couple of menus. The first menu will be a choice on putting the circles on a map of the US. With this, they would have to select what question they want to see, for example they would have to select Driverless car option to display that on the map over a different option. The other menu will change the circles based on the what is selected. If the user selects an age range, it will only show data from that age range. This will be the same for education/income. Both of these menus would be able to be selected at the same time. In other words, they can look at what age rand would want to ride in a driverless car and see where in the country people say yes/no.

## Schedule of Deliverables

**Week 1**: 10/2 -> 10/9
  * -[x] Find what census regions each entry belongs to
  * -[x] Modify dataset to say words, that represent the numbers, instead of numbers. Example: instead of using state = 1 change it so state = Alabama 
  * -[ ] Create the interactive feature that allows the user to select data to use from center chart. See task in [Questions & Tasks section](https://github.com/nasmith2/dataviz#questions--tasks) for more information.
  * -[x] Aggregate the data. Even though the designs are cool, this would be good to do.
  * -[ ] Add additional charts
    * -[ ] Get brain implants to improve your memory or mental capacity
    * -[ ] Eat meat that was grown in a lab
  
**Week 2** 10/9 -> 10/16. I believe this one might take longer
  * -[ ] Implement a menu that switches between a map view and the default view  (no map)
    * -[ ] Put the charts on the graph in the four regions (something similar to sketch 2)
    * -[ ] Add a menu that shows what graph should be shown in each section. The options would be one of the six on the default page.

**Week 3** 10/16 -> 10/23
  * -[ ] Add a menu that allows the user select between age, income, education. This menu should be able to be used on both the default and map view.
    * -[ ] Add a feature to allow the user to put in the age range
    * -[ ] Add the income ranges
    * -[ ] Add the education ranges

**Week 4** 10/23 -> 10/30
  * -[ ] Clean up. Make the code and graphs more appealing if needed. Will try to do as much as possible as I go.
