# Data Visualization Projects

## Smiley Face with Glasses

The [smiley face project](https://beta.vizhub.com/nasmith2/e4004c61dcee44e2be50cb30dacd6c8f) was the first project for the class. It was an introduction on the capabilities of visualization and how to use the program. As with most classes, the base that was made from this project, at what was learned during the project is what was used throughout the class. It was a great introduction into the class and the capabilities on the possibilities of the class.

## Etch-A-Sketch

The second project that I did for the class was a simple [Etch-A-Sketch](https://beta.vizhub.com/nasmith2/609cd1310ff349d5bbe146371d03dbd7). This was a great learning experience that taught me many features that can be implemented into a visualization project. This project contained keyboard interaction, color switching, and size manipulation. The other benefit of the project is that it allows for people to create their own visualizations from my visualization. Many great things have been drawn from an Etch-A-Sketch and to me it is a old technology that will be around for a while. 

While, this visualization is great, there can be several improvements that can make it even better. For example, one can add a feature to allow the user to use more than one line and each line can work independently with different colors and sizes. This will allow for more complex and creative drawings to be made.

## What People Think of Technology Change in the next 50 Years

This was the last project that I did for the class. This was a large project tat encompassed what we have learned throughout the class along with what I can come up with. This project had potential to start with and still has potential for future work.

#### Data

The data that was used for this project is about [how people think about technology change in the next 50 years](https://gist.github.com/nasmith2/f7306cec68cf23c53a77f03efe7d70c0#file-technologychangebetterorworse-csv). As technology is developing at a fast rate, understanding how people feel about the upcoming change is important to know. This data is only 5 years old but it gets important data about some of the technology changes that are currently happening. For example, it asked people if they would want to ride in a autonomous car. This is something that is being developed now and is close to being on the roads and is even on some roads in certain countries. 

Another factor it asks about is how people feel about granting drones privileges to fly in the US airspace. Drones in themselves have a huge market if they continue to develop. Finding out how people feel about drones flying around can show if companies need to help promote the benefits of drones flying. The data also shows what people do not want to see in future technology changes. Interestingly enough, by looking at the data, one can find see that even though most people think that the change in technology will be for the better, most examples that were given the majority of people think they would be the change for the worse.

#### Questions

The following couple questions drove the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

Overall, do people think technology change is good/bad and in what instances?
<br />Does it matter where someone lives in the country? 

#### Views

##### Default View

The first view that is shown is the default view. In this view, the questions that were asked about how people think about technology change are displayed in a pie charts that surround the center pie chart which displays the overall view of how people think of technology change in the next 50 years. Interestingly enough, when you look at the data shown in this view, one can notice that even though the majority of people think that the technology change in the next 50 years is good, they think the technology changes that the questions asked about are bad changes. 

Another thing that can be done in the default view is to sort the data. If one decides to sort the data, the center circle will highlight the section that was sorted while the outer circles will use only the data from what was selected. For example, if one would want to sort by for the better, the outer circles will only show the data from the people who answered that Technology change is for the better. This is to show that even though people think technology change would be for the better, we can see how they actually think about the individual subjects.

##### Map View

The second view that the project is capable of is a map view. This view puts the charts on top of a US map depending on the four census regions. The point of the view is to allow the user to see if certain areas of the country is more positive or negative to the technology changes and in what areas. One can select what question they want to be displayed on the map by selecting it from the drop-down menu located on the top of the visualization. From this view one can see that is a slight difference in views on the map. It seems that in the Northeast and the West sections more people think that the changes are for the better. Although the changes are small, one can think that the reason for the slight differences are because they are in the areas of the country that are on the forefront of technology changes. The Northeast has MIT and Carnegie Mellon along with other companies that are in R&D while the West is known for Silicon Valley.   

#### Future Work
There are several different things that could be added to this visualization. The dataset has a ton of information of the people who took the survey. They have information on the age, income and the education of the people who took the survey. If one can figure out what the numbers correlate with what ranges where used in the survey then more information can be displayed. One can sort the information on the income and education subjects to determine if the income or education matter to how people think of technology changes. Another aspect of this project that can be fixed is that the colors move when we sort in the default view. This could be fixed so that if the user does sort the data the color order would stay the same.
